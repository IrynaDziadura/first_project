Dusk Till Dawn

[Verse 1: ZAYN]
Not tryna be in there
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, how you choose?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
 
[Interlude: ZAYN]
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins
Just me and you
 
[Pre-Chorus: ZAYN & Sia]
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
(baby I'm right here)
